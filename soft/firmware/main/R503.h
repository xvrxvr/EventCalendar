 * the R503 fingerprint sensor communicates over UART with the microcontroller
 * default baudrate is 57600

 *
 * error handling is done with the confirmation codes defined above
 * methods returning an integer return 
 *
 * the R503 has (in RAM)
 *   - 1 image buffer
 *   - 6 character buffer 
 *       indexed with a number from 1 to 6
 *       they are used to either store the features extracted from the image or 
 *       a finger model, a so called template
 *       a template is obtained through fusion of features from 2 to 6 character buffers
 *       and needs the space of 2 character buffers when written back
 *
 * to enroll a finger
 *   1. takeImage(): get a fingerprint image and write it into the image buffer
 *   2. extractFeatures(k): extract features from the image buffer and write them into character buffer k
 *   3. repeat 1. step and 2. step 2 to 6 times with k starting from 1
 *   4. createTemplate(): fuse the extracted features into a template, which is written back to character buffer 1 and 2
 *                        (TODO check if it is really written back to character buffer 1 and 2)
 *   5. storeTemplate(1, l): store the template from character buffer 1 and 2 at location l in the library (flash memory)
 *
 * to find fingerprint
 *   1. takeImage()
 *   2. extractFeatures(k)
 *   3. searchFinger(k, l, s): searches the fingerprint library for template mathching features in character buffer k
 *                             location of matched fingerprint is stored in reference l and matching score in reference s
 *                             if no matching fingerprint is found R503_NO_MATCH_IN_LIBRARY is returned and l and s are set to 0
